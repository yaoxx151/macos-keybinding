Try to emulate some basic Emacs keybindings in macOS so that writing text, e.g. in
broswers, sucks less.

Put it under `~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict` (create
`~/Library/KeyBindings/` if not exist).

Would stop working when macOS no long respects `~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict`.
