Try to emulate some basic Emacs keybindings in macOS so that writing text, in, e.g. broswers, sucks less.

Put it under `~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict` (create
`~/Library/KeyBindings/` if not exist). Need to restart the application.

Hopefully, macOS wouldn't decide to stop respecting `~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict`.
